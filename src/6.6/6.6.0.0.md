# Release notes Shopware 6.6.0.0

## Abstract

Shopware 6.6.0.0 is a major release containing breaking changes.
Please read this document and the linked resources carefully. The system requirements have changed, and third-party dependencies have been updated, as explained below.

This release was built with the help of the community. Thank you for supporting us during the twelve-week RC phase by providing feedback and testing the release under production-like conditions, and thank you for 34 code contributors with 64 merged pull requests in this release.

With this release, we are also officially introducing a new release policy that provides up to two years of support for major versions, starting with Shopware 6.5. A detailed explanation can be found in our blog: [Shopware's new Release Policy](https://www.shopware.com/en/news/shopwares-new-release-policy/)

The Shopware 6.6.0.0 release is focused on core changes instead of features. It provides a foundation for adding new features throughout future minor releases.

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.2 and 8.3
* tested on MySQL 8 and MariaDB 10.11

See below for more information on the current minimum versions.

## Improvements

### Removal of deprecations

All code marked as deprecated for 6.6 was removed. This potentially breaks extensions and other customizations. Please see the  [UPGRADE.md](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/trunk/UPGRADE-6.6.md) for detailed information on what has changed.

### Removal of feature flags

Some specific features have already been released and marked with a feature flag. These features are now active by default, introducing breaking changes and requiring code updates:

* New media path behaviour
* Stock Handling
* Change ElasticSearch mapping data to support multi-languages in one index
* Vuejs 3
* Asynchronous theme compilation via message queue
* Async JS plugin loading
* Caching layer improvements

See [details on Github](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ashopware%2Fshopware++Feature%3A%3AisActive('v6.6.0.0')&type=code)

### Removal of experimental state

The experimental annotation has been removed from features.

* AsyncThemeCompilation
* QuoteManagement
* Async JS plugin loading

These and a few more features are now stable and can be used in production.

### Vue.js update

[Vue.js 2 is no longer supported](https://endoflife.date/vue) since the end of 2023. We updated the administration component to the latest version of Vue.js, ensuring our customers receive up-to-date and compliant software. A tutorial on how to adapt your plugin-system-based extension to Vue.js 3 is available in the [documentation](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/resources/references/upgrades/administration/vue3.html).

### Webpack update

We updated [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to version 5. The new version and switching from Babel zu [SWC](https://swc.rs/) makes building the administration three times faster. Plugin-system-based extensions with a custom webpack configuration must be migrated to the webpack 5 API.

### Node 20 as the minimum version

As [discussed](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/discussions/3359), the minimum version requirement for Node was changed from 18 to 20. Version 20 is the current LTS version with active support until the end of 2024 and maintenance support until mid-2026.

### Configurable auto logout

The administration login form now has the option to stay signed in, keeping the user logged in for 14 days instead of the previous 30 minutes.

### Symfony upgrade

Shopware 6.6.0.0 upgraded Symfony to the current stable major version 7, as previously announced on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/discussions/3354). More about breaking changes in this Symfony upgrade can be found in [Symfony's upgrade guide](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/7.0/UPGRADE-7.0.md).

### PHP 8.2 as the minimum requirement

With the upgrade to Symfony 7, PHP 8.2 will become the new minimum required version. Refer to the [release information by Symfony](https://symfony.com/releases/7.0) and **check compatibility with your hosting provider**.

### Maria DB 10.11 minimum requirement

The minimum version requirement for Maria DB now is the latest LTS version, v10.11. This version supports the `JSON_OVERLAPS` function, which the "delete unused media" feature needs. MySQL was previously changed to a minimum version of 8.0.

### Redis 7.0 minimum requirement

The minimum version requirement for Redis now is v7.0. It comes with performance improvements and allows using the new [redis function feature](https://redis.io/docs/interact/programmability/functions-intro/).

### Upgrading third-party composer dependencies

We upgraded some third-party composer dependencies, such as `lcobucci/jwt` to v5 or higher and `async-aws/simple-s3` to v2 or higher.

### Stock API changes

We simplified the way Shopware stores stock data and made the system more extendable for developers. It became easier to supplement the stock information with user-defined data and to send it to third-party systems. It is also possible to turn off Shopware's stock management altogether. The new Stock API was introduced in Shopware 6.5.5 behind the `STOCK_HANDLING` feature flag; it is now the default method in Shopware 6.6.

To keep the impact as low as possible, we kept the backwards compatibility for reading the stock. Please note that the feature *multi-inventory* has yet to be compatible. Find more details in the [discussions](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/discussions/3172), the [changelog](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/trunk/changelog/release-6-5-5-0/2023-06-21-stock-refactoring.md), and in our [docs for extending the API](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/content/stock/).

### Persistent media path storage

The path to media is now stored in the database instead of being generated on the fly. Please read more about this topic in [discussions](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/discussions/3174).

### Improving the caching layer

Improvements on the caching layer were previously available behind a feature flag. They are now active and available by default. Read [discussion #3299](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/discussions/3299) and [discussion #3171](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/discussions/3171) for more information.

### Availability of symfony/scheduler

Symfony recently added a scheduler component, and we want to use as many official Symfony components as possible. Starting with Shopware 6.6, the Symfony scheduler can be used to execute scheduled tasks instead of the custom Shopware scheduler. For details on how to set it up, take a look at the [documentation](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/v6.6rc/guides/hosting/infrastructure/scheduled-task.html#using-the-symfony-scheduler-to-run-tasks).

### Multilingual ElasticSearch index

The ElasticSearch index is no longer split by language. Translated fields are mapped as object fields. This change in indexing brings performance improvements. Please be aware of this when providing custom properties in ElasticSearch. For more details, please read our [architecture decision record](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/trunk/adr/2023-04-11-new-language-inheritance-mechanism-for-opensearch.md).

### Async JavaScript loading

By introducing asynchronous JS loading and allowing dynamic imports, we could increase the storefront performance and smoothen the JS handling. Read the [discussions](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/discussions/3310) and the [documentation](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/v6.6rc/guides/plugins/plugins/storefront/add-custom-javascript.html#registering-an-async-plugin) for more details.

### Removal of SCSS code

Custom SCSS code was removed from Shopware if it already existed in Bootstrap. Please read more about this in our [architecture decision record](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/trunk/adr/2023-10-19-bootstrap-css-utils.md).

### Low-priority Queue

Before Shopware 6.6.0.0, workers automatically consumed the low-priority queue. Workers for the low-priority queue now have to be started separately. For more details, take a look at the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/v6.6.0.0-rc6/UPGRADE-6.6.md#configure-queue-workers-to-consume-low_priority-queue).
