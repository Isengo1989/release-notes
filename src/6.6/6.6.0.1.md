# Release notes Shopware 6.6.0.1

## Abstract

This patch release contains just one bug, fixing a problem that the storefront was not available after an update as a specific change in a database column was expected. This change didn't take effect if a destructive migration has not been run for a long time (< v6.5) and just the `system:update:finish` command was used.

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.2 and 8.3
* tested on MySQL 8 and MariaDB 10.11

## Fixed bugs

* [NEXT-34524](https://issues.shopware.com/issues/NEXT-34524) | Missing migration for payload column in cart table (0 votes)
