# Release notes Shopware 6.6.0.2

## Abstract

This patch release fixes a bug where (in dependency of CMS options taken) the default order on listing pages have been influenced. As a result, some listings have not been displayed on these pages. This is why we added a migration to change the sorting key accordingly in CMS slots to fix potential problems with the loading of listings.
